# Clone of EZTV using Vue.js and the EZTV api

## Why?
No ads.

## But ad blockers?
The ad code on EZTV is out of control. If you block ads, it tries to route around this with webRTC. I just dont want that much malicious, obfuscated code running on my machine.

Until recently, one could simply disable JS and avoid the problem entirely. Unfortunately, they've recently started using cloudflare DDoS protection which requires JS to display the site.

So I made this. Hopefully somebody finds it useful.
